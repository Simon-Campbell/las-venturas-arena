	Setting Up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile LVA you must leave the file structure intact, then open "lva.pwn"
with Pawno and hit the compile button (F5).

Running LVA requires the server to have an LVA compatible SQLite database in your
servers "scriptfiles" folder. There is an LVA compatible SQLite database packaged
with LVA, it is named "lva_gm.db".

"lva.amx" needs to be placed in your servers "gamemodes" directory.

Once you have satisfied these requirements you should be able to start LVA. To
start LVA you must type "changemode lva" into your SA-MP server (remote-)console.

Once you're ingame you probably want to set the level of your account, the system was
designed to allow anyone who is either RCON admin or level 3 or higher to be a
"manager". To set your account to level 3 or higher you must log into RCON and set your
level... RCON is the master level, you should really set your RCON pass to something
obscure and hard to guess/crack once you have set your level.
